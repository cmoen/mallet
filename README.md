This is a port of Mallet that uses HPPC instead of Trove.

The porting has been done in a simple manner and the code could probably have
been made to run more efficiently by taking advantage of HPPC's lower-level
programming model. Overall testing of this port is limited and there could be
mistakes, although none are currently known. Use this software on your own risk.
